Notes I take while developing the program.

Goals:

1. Anyone with or without a call sign can register.
2. Profile to record contact information and privacy preferences.
3. Members can view club roster (and download as spreadsheet or pdf)
4. Track operating capabilities.
5. Submit to WPA ARES site (record when submitted, and verify sufficient information for submitting).
6. Track when payments were made.
7. Paypal/Google Checkout/Stripe integration.
8. OAuth style authentication (google/yahoo/twitter/facebook)
9. Perhaps synchronize login with dokuwiki?
